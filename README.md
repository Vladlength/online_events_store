'#online_store' 

this is my pet project written in Python using the django framework.

This is an online store selling tickets for events. Perhaps the design is not the best, but in the first place was the ultimate practice of using the django framework.

I wrote the project in my free time, perhaps I will continue to work on this project in the future.
